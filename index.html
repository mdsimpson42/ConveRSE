<p>Welcome to DiscouRSE.</p>
<p>
    This site is intended to be a hub for information, resources and blog posts about mental health, aimed at 
    - but not exclusively for - Research Software Engineers (RSEs), Research Technical Professionals (RTPs)
    and other members of the Research Software Community.
</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
    RSEs and other technical professionals working in academia face a unique set of challenges, 
    which can have a significant impact on our mental health.
</p>
<p>
    We are a relatively new profession, with limited recognition and career development options. We often work alone,
    switching between multiple projects and technologies, with researchers who are world leaders in fields we know nothing about.
    This can lead to isolation, imposter syndrome and <a href="tags/burnout.html">burnout</a>, 
    as well as other issues like depression and anxiety.

<h2>What is this site?</h2>
<p>
    The aim of this site is to provide a centralised resource for mental health information and support, 
    as well as a platform for sharing experiences and advice.
</p>
<p>
    The site will include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="tips/self">Tips and advice</a> on self-care and mental health, tailored to the needs of the Research Software Community.
    </li>
    <li>
        The results of <a href="survey">Dave Horsfall's Survey into Mental Health</a>
        n the Research Software Community, conducted in 2022.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <a href="blog">blog</a> containing stories, tips and advice on self-care and mental health from members of the community.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="support">Links</a> to other resources and support networks.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We believe that by sharing experiences and resources from a wide and diverse set of contributors,  
    we can support ourselves and each other, and help to improve the mental health and wellbeing of the community.
