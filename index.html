<p>Welcome to the Mental Health RSEsource.</p>
<p>
    This site is intended to be a hub for information, resources and blog posts about mental health, aimed at 
    - but not exclusively for - Research Software Engineers (RSEs), Research Technical Professionals (RTPs)
    and other members of the Research Software Community.
</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
    RSEs and other technical professions working in academia face a unique set of challenges, 
    which can have a significant impact on our mental health.
</p>
<p>
    We are a relatively new profession, with limited recognition and career development options. We often work alone,
    switching between multiple projects, with researchers who are world leaders in fields we know nothing about.
    This can lead to isolation, imposter syndrome, and burnout, as well as other issues like depression and anxiety.
</p>
<h2>What is this site?</h2>
<p>
    The aim of this site is to provide a centralised resource for mental health information and support, 
    as well as a platform for sharing experiences and advice.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The results of Dave Horsfall's Survey into Mental Health in the Research Software Community, conducted in 2022.
    </li>
    <li>
        A blog containing stories, tips and advice on self-care and mental health from members of the community.
    </li>
    <li>
        Links to other resources and support networks.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    We believe that by sharing experiences and resources, we can help to support each other and improve the mental health of the community.
</p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>
    This site was created by Dr Mike Simpson, a research software engineer, who has a decade of experience in the industry,
    as well as a history of mental health issues. You can read more about his experiences on <a>the blog</a>.

    The site was created as part of Mike's Fellowship with the
