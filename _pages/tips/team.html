<h2>Looking after your team</h2>
<p>Tips for RSE leaders for looking after your team:</p>

<h3>Consider appointing a Mental Health First Aider</h3>
<p>
    Having a Mental Health First Aider (MHFA) in your team can help to create a supportive environment 
    where people feel able to talk about their mental health. Mental Health First Aiders are trained to listen, 
    reassure and respond, and can also signpost further support if needed.
</p>
<p>
    MHFA training costs Â£325 and is delivered by a number of charities and organisations across the UK. 
    The training is usually delivered over two days, in-person or online, and covers a range of mental health conditions,
    as well as how to support someone who is experiencing a mental health crisis.
