<h3>Getting Help and Support</h3>
<p>If you are struggling, and feel like you need additional support, there are a number of options available.</p>
<p>
  There are a number of organisations that can provide more information and support about a range of problems, 
  if you need urgent help. These are discussed in more detail on our <a href="support.html">Get Help</a> page.

<p>If your situation is less urgent, you might consider the options below.</p>
<p>"It's better to raise a red flag before you're forced to wave a white one."</p>

  <li>
    Talk to your line manager - they may be able to help you solve problems, provide additional support or adjust deadlines.</li>
  <li>
    Support from your Institution - most universities have an Employee Assistance Programme or similar, which provides
    confidential support and advice, often including free counselling sessions.

    Occupational Health - if the situation is more serious, occupational health may be able to help evaluate and support your needs,
    including giving you time off to recover.

    Your Doctor/GP - your doctor may have useful advice and can also prescribe medication to help manage your condition.
